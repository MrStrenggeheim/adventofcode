# adventofcode23
Here, you can find my personal solution for the Advent of Code tasks at the end of each day.
This is not meant to leak any riddle solutions but rather to force myself into writing cleaner and more readable code. 
But feel free to discover new ways to solve these problems and to copy any ideas that could help you.
